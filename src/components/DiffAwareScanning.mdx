To enable diff-aware scanning, Semgrep provides a `SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF` environment variable that users can set with the **commit hash** or **branch name** as the baseline. For example, given a repository with 10 commits, setting `SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF` to the 8th commit will return results introduced by changes in the 9th and 10th commit.

To only report findings newly added since branching off from your `main` branch, set the following:
<pre class="language-bash"><code>SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF=<span className="placeholder">TOPIC-BRANCH-NAME</span></code></pre>

To only report findings newly added
after a specific commit, set the following:
<pre class="language-bash"><code>SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF=<span className="placeholder">INSERT_GIT_COMMIT_HASH</span></code></pre>
